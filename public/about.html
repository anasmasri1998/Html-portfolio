<h1>About Me</h1>
 <p> Hello there! I'm a passionate fourth-year Computer Science Engineering student at Chalmers University,
   where I'm delving into the intricate world of code and algorithms. Beyond the classroom, I'm a dedicated
    full-stack developer, constantly honing my skills during my free time.</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in the digital realm, you'll find me pushing my physical limits.
 I'm an avid practitioner of calisthenics, a form of exercise that utilizes one's own body
  weight for strength and flexibility training. Picture gravity-defying moves, elegant body control,
   and a commitment to the art of movement.</p>

<p>Additionally, I hit the gym to indulge in some classic weight lifting,
 finding the perfect balance between the virtual and physical realms. '
 It's not just about writing lines of code for me; it's about sculpting my mind and body in harmony.</p>

<p>My journey as a student and a developer has taught me the importance of discipline, resilience,
 and the thrill of overcoming challenges. I'm excited to bring this passion and determination 
 to any project or team, ready to code, create, and conquer. Let's build something incredible together!</p>
